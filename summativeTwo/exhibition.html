            <h4>Why</h4>
            <p>Clay keeps the brain flexible. Knowing what you can fix, and thinking outside the box to do so are very valuable skills. Life, like pottery, is a process. Before you can throw, you must wedge your clay, eliminating air bubbles and aligning the tiny platelets. <br><br>Pottery can be one’s personal meditation, a time to get lost in the feeling of your hands on the swirling clay and your feet on the ground. Dragging a carving tool over the surface of a just-dry piece or painting on glaze, unloading a kiln or recycling old clay - every part of the process was so magical. You felt stable and relaxed and utterly free of all your obligations and worries.

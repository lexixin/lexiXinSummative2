        <h2>about</h2>
        <p>Clay keeps the brain flexible. Knowing what you can fix, and thinking outside the box to do so are very valuable skills. Life, like pottery, is a process. Before you can throw, you must wedge your clay, eliminating air bubbles and aligning the tiny platelets. <br><br>Thatâ€™s why more and more people are interested in pottery now. <br><br>Whether you are an expert potter or ceramist, a beginner or even has no prior experience with pottery, you are all welcomed to join this exhibition.</p>
        <h2>artist</h2>
        <p>At this exhibition, you will have your chance to talk to the amazing ceramists and potters and share your passion and stories.</p>
